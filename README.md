# twee-v3

twee-v3 is a parser for the twee 3 interactive fiction format

More information about the twee 3 specification can be found here:
 [twee-3-specification.md](https://github.com/iftechfoundation/twine-specs/blob/master/twee-3-specification.md)

This crate exists because I want to parse really minimalist stories written using [Twine](https://twinery.org/).

It currently doesn't (and maybe never will) suport scripts.
